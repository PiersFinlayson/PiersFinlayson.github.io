This weekend quickie features me upgrading my Amiga 500 to 1MB of on-motherboard chip RAM, in an attempt to resolve some graphical corruption issues.

This Amiga 500 had a very corroded 512KB RAM expansion board, and I was hitting intermittent graphical corruption in some titles, which appeared to resolve when I reseated the expansion board.  I decided to use the 514256 RAM ICs from the expansion board to upgrade the Amiga to 1MB of chip RAM, as this motherboard is the 6A revision and natively supports this mod.  

However, that didn't seem to resolve my graphical issues, as they returned when testing with Shadow of the Beast II.
