In this episode I power up and test my Commodore 2040 disk drive - the earliest example of an IEEE-488 double disk drive I own.

While I cleaned the heads, cleaned and reseated a bunch of connectors, and lubed one of the drive mechanisms, I don't think any of this was necessary.  Once I understood that the 2040 has CBM DOS v1 installed, and that you need to initial a disk after inserting, before using it - everything worked swimmingly.  The command to initialize the drive is OPEN1,8,15,"I0":CLOSE1 (use I1 for drive 1).
