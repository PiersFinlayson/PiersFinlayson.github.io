In this second weekend quickie I fix two toys from my childhood - a Major Morgan Electronic Organ, and a Fisher Price Music Box Record Player.  And I'm quite rude about it.

Problems found with Major Morgan:  
- The conductive material from under the top keypad membrame had worn away.  I painted some new conductive (carbon) paint on.  
- The top keypad membrame was crumpled and not making good contact.  I ironed it.  

Problems found with the record player:  
- The whole mechanism needed a good oil.  I gave it a good oil, with a light sewing machine oil.  
- One of the very small plastic gears had a crack in it causing a rhythmic clicking.  I didn't fix this as I didn't think I could reassemble the mechanism after taking it apart, and I had no replacent gear (with it being too small to 3D print with my printer).
