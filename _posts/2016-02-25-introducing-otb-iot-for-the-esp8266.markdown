# Out of the Box Internet of Things

otb-iot is software for ESP8266 devices which is intended to make the ESP8266 quick and easy to deploy for _real_ applications and to be _robust_.

There’s a huge amount of hacking and playing going on with the ESP8266 today, which is a fantastic thing for all hobbyists, enthusiasts and those looking to develop deployable products. But while it’s very quick and easy to get stuff running on the ESP8266, and even to cobble together something that provides a lot of function, making it fully featured enough to actually deploy and maintain in the field takes effort.

This is where otb-iot comes in - it’s a complete software image for the ESP8266 which is intended to be this robust and deployable solution.
