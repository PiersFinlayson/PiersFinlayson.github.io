# SOT23 Breakout Board

My smallest breakout board to date, costing a mere $0.20 each from [OSHpark](https://oshpark.com) is for generic SOT23 packages.  I wanted this as I'm planning to experiment with the [MCP 24AA00](http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/21178d.pdf) 128-bit I2C eeprom for use with my devices.  In particular I want to use these to store a unique, programmable by me, serial number.  These parts are 5 pin SOT23s, but I decided having a part which could breakout any number of pins up to 6 would be useful, so that's what I've gone for.  These boards come in at roughly 8mm x 9mm!
