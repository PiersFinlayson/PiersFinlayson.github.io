In this episode I fix the drive mechanism from the Commodore 2031 disk drive which was suffering from a 1541 identity crisis.  This involved rewinding the spindle motor tachometer, replacing the (replacement!) spindle motor drive belt, and fixing egregious alignment issues due to a dodgy track 0 stop.  

I previously diagnosed the tachometer issue in episode 3 of floppies rock: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hD0U8kDFsvc>

The problems I hit and fixed in this episode:  
- The replacement drive belt I previously fitted (4mm x 91mm diameter) turned out to be too big.  I ended up using 4mm x 88mm.  
- The stepper motor tachometer winding was broken.  I rewound with 40AWG magnet wire.  
- The drive was way out of alignment as the track 0 stop had been replaced with a bent paperclip.  I adjusted the bent paperclip and re-aligned.  I may replace the bent paperclip with a better solution in future.
