In this episode I explore a rare Commodore 1551 disk drive, fix it in the process and learn a little bit about BASIC v3.5 on the Plus 4 and Commodore 16.  I also do a head-to-head speed test of the 1551 against a 1541 loading Lemmings.

Problems with this drive:  
- The read/write head on the Newtronics/Mitsumi mechanism had failed with some of the coil resistances being 15k ohms.  I replaced the drive mechanism (including the head) with another identical mechanism from a 1541 drive.  
- The cartridge port on my Plus 4 and the cartridge connector on the 1551 were a bit dirty - some cleaning fixed them both.
