I've just published some [mods](https://www.packom.net/m-bus-master-hat-mods/) which can be made to [M-Bus Master Hats](https://www.packom.net/m-bus-master-hat/).  These include:

* Adding a USB Micro socket and associated componentry to allow the Hat to be powered directly, and backpower a Pi.

* Allowing the Hat EEPROM to be disabled, to allow compatibility with other Hats that also provide an EEPROM.

* Allowing the GPIO used to control power to the M-Bus to be changed.
