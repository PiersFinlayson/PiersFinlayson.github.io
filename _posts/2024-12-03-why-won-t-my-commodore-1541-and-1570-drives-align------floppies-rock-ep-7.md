In this episode I think I'm going to have an easy time of it by aligning both Commodore 1541-II and 1570 drives.  However, it turns out there's more to the supposed alignment issues than I first thought.

The problems I hit and fixed in this episode:  

1541-II  
- Drive was unable to read most of the tracks when running an alignment test.  It also wouldn't load a copy protected version of Arkanoid II.  
- Heads were dirty.  I cleaned them.  
- Even with clean heads, the final few tracks appeared misaligned.  I diagnosed a lack of lubrication (particularly on the drive head cable) and lubricated it.  

1570  
- Drive appeared mis-aligned, for the first few and last few tracks only.  It also wouldn't load a copy protected version of Arkanoid II.  
- It turned out the eject mechanism wasn't functioning properly, preventing the read write head from making good contact with the disk media.  I bent the eject mechanism so it would work reliably.
