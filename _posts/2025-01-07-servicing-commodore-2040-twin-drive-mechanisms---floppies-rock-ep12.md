In this episode, which is part 2 of me working on this drive, I remove and service both drive units within a Commodore 2040, which are Shugart 390 full height 5.25" drives.  I also again struggle to operate the 2040, in part I think because it's running a very old ROM, and in part because I don't yet know what I'm doing.  

The first part of me working on this drive is here: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upF7QE-Wa2o>
