Learn how to control vintage Commodore disk drives using modern Rust code.  This video demonstrates building a bridge between 2025's systems programming and 1970s and 1980s hardware using the rs1541 crate and rs1541-cli program.  

Rocking Rust #2 - Using Rust to test Commodore disk drives - floppies rock ep15  

In this episode, I use Rust-based rs1541 and rs1541cli to test out my newest Commodore 1570 drive, and extend rs1541-cli to implement a bus scanning feature.  

Skip ahead to 12:10 and 21:04 if you're interested in Rust.
