I bought this 1571 as non-working off ebay - the seller said it had powered on just fine, and two minutes later went pop.  In the process of fixing it I discover different points to connect neutral to on the PCB for 220V and 240V and operate it in double-sided mode with the C64.

Problems with this drive:
- Just one - that the incoming mains filter unit had gone short circuit (11 ohms across live/neutral).  Looks like something exploded inside.  Fix was to replace with a new filter unit and then the drive worked fine.
