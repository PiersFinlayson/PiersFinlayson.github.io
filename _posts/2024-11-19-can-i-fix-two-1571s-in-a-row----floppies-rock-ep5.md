This episode focuses on my second Commodore 1571, which provides much more challenging to diagnose and repair than the first unit (ep4).

Problems with this drive:  
- The last numpty to work on this drive connected all of the spindle motor, stepper motor and LED sensor connectors the wrong way around - leading to a short on the 12V line, and even once that was cleared, the drive just not working at all, mostly with DRIVE NOT READY.  I eventually figured that out, and that didn't seem to have led to any permanent problems.  
- Once that problem was fixed, it turned out the lower (under side, side 1) read/write head had failed somewhere within the sealed head unit itself - I don't have a spare head unit, so this drive will become a spares drive.
