The M-Bus Master Hat is a add-on board designed for the Raspberry Pi which controls the physical layer of an [M-Bus](http://www.m-bus.com/).  It can be used in conjunction with a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and software such as [libmbus](https://github.com/rscada/libmbus) to provide a cost effective solution to allow you to connect to and read M-Bus slaves, such as water, heat and electricity meters that implement the wired M-Bus protocol.

</p>

The M-Bus Master Hat is fully compliant with the [Raspberry Pi Hat specifications](https://github.com/raspberrypi/hats).  It is compatible with any Raspberry Pi which includes the 40 pin header.  This includes all current Raspberry Pi boards, from the Pi 1 Model B+ (2014) onwards, including the Raspberry Pi Zero.

# Getting Started

Instructions on using the M-Bus Master Hat can be found [here](/m-bus/master/instructions).

# Features

* Supports all Raspberry Pi boards from the Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+ (2014) onwards including:

  * Raspberry Pi 1 Model A+.

  * Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+.

  * Raspberry Pi 2 Model B.

  * Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+.

  * Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+.

  * Raspberry Pi Zero.

  * Raspberry Pi Zero W.

  * Raspberry Pi Zero WH.

* Supports up to 3 slave devices connected to device simultaneously.

* Supports up to 100m bus length.

* Supports the following baud rates:

  * 300

  * 600

  * 1200

  * 2400

  * 4800

  * 9600

* Optical isolation between Raspberry Pi and M-Bus.

* Hat and M-Bus powered by Raspberry Pi - no external power supply needed.

* Includes on-board protection to avoid M-Bus from drawing too much power from the Pi.

* Communcates with Raspberrry Pi GPIO serial pins - doesn't use up a USB port.

* Provides a reduced footprint when compared to separate a Pi + USB M-Bus Master solution.

* M-Bus power is controllable via the Raspberry Pi in software.

* Power and M-Bus enabled LEDs.

* Conforms to Raspberry Pi Hat specifications.

* Same form factor as Raspberry Pi 1/3 Models A+.

* Supplied with standoffs to allow the Hat to be securely mounted to the Raspberry Pi.

* Compatible with open source M-Bus master software [libmbus](https://github.com/rscada/libmbus).

# Coming Soon

A Raspbery Pi M-Bus Slave Hat will be available by middle 2019.

A Raspberry Pi based M-Bus Master HTTP server compatible with the Raspberry Pi M-Bus Master Hat will be available by middle 2019.

If there is enough interest, it may be possible to produce a Raspberry Pi M-Bus Master Micro-Hat, which would be the same form factor as a Raspberry Pi Zero.  If you are interested in this please [contact me](mailto:mbus@packom.net).
